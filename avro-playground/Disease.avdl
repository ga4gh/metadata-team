/**
This is the prototype for the "Disease" record type. This is thought to be the main 
wrapper for any given diagnosis, and to contain one or several ontologyTerm objects
for its definition.
Disease records can be stored/referenced in "Diseases" lists inside parental objects 
(e.g. Individual, Sample).
The Disease record type could conceivably used as blueprint for generation of a 
similarly structured Phenotype object.
Observations, interventions etc. should be kept external to the "Disease" object 
but can be referenced using "evidence" type objects (which have yet to be defined).
