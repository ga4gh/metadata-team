The "metadata-team" format testing repository
=============================================

This repository has been mostly dormant, with much of the format testing & development being placed elsewhere:

* [Test datasets as "ready for MongoDB" collections](https://github.com/mbaudis/arraymap2ga4gh), based on the cancer genome data collection from [arraymap.org](http://arraymap.org)
    * This is an actively maintained implementation of the current and some forward looking (i.e. with a reasonable PR/plan) schema features. It should be possible to get the collections, load them into an e.g. MongoDB instance, and the test methods against these. This implementation study is part of [Elixir's human data projects](http://elixir-europe.org).


Previous Notes:
---------------

The metadata-team project is a communication and "playground" area for exchanging data and ideas regarding everything metadata<sup>*</sup>. The main envisioned usage for now is to add (PR) documents examplifying data annotation usage scenarios.

The standard usage would be to create a fork of the repositry, and then to add/edit the respective documents. For example files, the preference would be to create dummy cases as <document>.json files.

For further information, please consult the [GA4GH.DWG.MTT wiki](https://github.com/ga4gh/metadata-team/wiki).
