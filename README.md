metadata-team
=============

The metadata-team project is a communication and "playground" area for exchanging data and ideas regarding everyting metadata<sup>*</sup>. The main envisioned usage for now is to add (PR) documents examplifying data annotation usage scenarios.

The standard usage would be to create a fork of the repositry, and then to add/edit the respective documents. For example files, the preference would be to create dummy cases as <document>.json files.

For further information, please consult the [GA4GH.DWG.MTT wiki](wiki).
